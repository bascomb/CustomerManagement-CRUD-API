ClickBank coding-challenge
================

Thank you for taking the ClickBank Coding Challenge. We want to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your abilities while giving us a good sense of how you approach and address challenges. 

#### Create a NodeJS app which will serve as the backend of your application. 
* Feel free to use something like ExpressJS, NextJS, etc... to generate your application boilerplate. We use Material Design for UI components. Feel free to use that, or any other UI UI framework if you'd like. 
* Support the following routes
  * / Main listing of users (details below)
  * /user/{userId} User details page

#### Use the API to fetch some data and display it on a page.
* Fetch some data from https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20 . This will give you an list of users.
* Display the users in a table. Include at least first, last, email, and profile image.  Provide a link to the full user profile in one of the columns. This link should take you to /users/{userId}
* With javascript, sort the users by name asc/desc.
* Add a behavior so that if you hover over the username, the user details appear in a modal. 

#### For an additional WOW factor, consider implementing the following:
* Use ReactJS for your solution. We have standardized on ReactJS in all of our applications.
* Use Material design for your project
* Make the styles responsive to window changes. 
* Add any embellishments that allow you to show off your skills!

#### Submission
* Fork this repo, commit your work, issue a pull request.
* Please note, when the interview process has concluded you will be removed from the github team, which will also delete your fork of our private repo.
